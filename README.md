# Thermally and Vibrationally Enhanced Machining (FYP)

**Final Year MEng Project – University of Bath (2025)**  
*Shortlisted for the Geoff Herrington Innovation Award*  
📎 [Project Report (PDF)](link-to-report) | 🖼️ [Poster Presentation](link-to-poster)

This project models, simulates, and experimentally validates **hybrid machining** techniques combining laser/plasma heating and ultrasonic vibration to enhance performance when cutting aerospace alloys like **Ti-6Al-4V** and **Inconel 718**.

The goal: reduce tool wear, improve surface finish, and extend machine tool life through thermal and vibrational enhancements.

## 🔬 Core Objectives

- Develop a **validated Abaqus/Explicit FEA model** for thermally-assisted and vibration-assisted cutting
- Investigate performance improvements using:
  - Mode A/B thermal enhancement (laser vs torch)
  - 1D and elliptical ultrasonic vibration
- Conduct experimental validation using **DMG MORI CNC machine**
- Explore tool wear, chip morphology, cutting forces, and surface integrity
