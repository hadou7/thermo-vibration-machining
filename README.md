# Thermally Enhanced Machining

Final-year mechanical engineering project focused on improving cutting performance on aerospace alloys using laser and vibration enhancements.

## Key Highlights
- Simulated cutting forces, temperature, and chip formation in ABAQUS CAE
- Developed control strategies for thermal enhancement using 1D and 2D elliptical tool vibration with laser-heated workpiece
- Validated against experimental data using ultrasonic-assisted CNC machining at 0, 15, 20, 30kHz
- Tools: ABAQUS, Fortran, Autodesk Inventor
